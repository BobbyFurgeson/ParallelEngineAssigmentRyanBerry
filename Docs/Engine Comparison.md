Engine Comparison- Ryan Berry, U1458010

I think the one thing that was consistent across all three engines was the ease of import on all three. I felt like getting the assets into the engine was easy and didn’t make me want to pull my hair out. They also all use the same transformation shortcuts, which made moving, scaling, and rotating easy. They all bind to W, E, R for them. Getting into difference I don’t like how Unity, at least as far as I could tell, didn’t have ways to move making meshes in a separate window or tab. This made making meshes a little more annoying. Godot was interesting in that even making actor objects requires making a whole new scene. Unreal is what I am most familiar with, so I think I have a bias about it.

I think blueprint actors are the most intuitive, followed by prefabs and then finally scenes. It felt weird that to make an instance, I basically needed to create a whole level for it.

If I had to redo the assignment, I would likely just use Unreal. Unity had countless issues for me with trying to get GitHub to work and package errors. Gordot wasn’t bad, but I feel the way the scene system works, I would just end up getting confused.
